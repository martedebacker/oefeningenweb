  <h1>The Box Model</h1>
  <div>
    Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is
    key to being able to create layouts with CSS, or to align items with other
    items.
  </div>
  <div>
    The full CSS box model applies to block boxes, inline boxes only use some
    of the behavior defined in the box model. The model defines how the
    different parts of a box — <strong>margin</strong>,
    <strong>border</strong>, <strong>padding</strong>, and
    <strong>content</strong>
    — work together to create a box that you can see on the page.
  </div>
  <div>
    For a div element the default value for <strong>margin</strong>,
    <strong>border</strong> and <strong>padding</strong> is zero.
