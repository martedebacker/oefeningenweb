            <h1>Creating a card with badges</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>You can create a list of badges using both <code>display: flex</code> and
                <code>display: inline-block</code> in HTML and CSS. Each method has its advantages, depending
                on the level of flexibility and control you need.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Flexbox</strong> provides more control over the layout, making it easier to center,
                        space, or
                        align badges both horizontally and vertically. It's also more responsive by default, handling
                        different
                        screen sizes better.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Inline block</strong> is a simpler approach and can work well for static,
                        horizontal layouts. Badges will wrap automatically if there's not enough space, but controlling
                        spacing,
                        alignment, and responsiveness might require more manual adjustments.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both methods are acceptable, so your choice depends on your design needs and whether you want more
                control or
                simplicity.</p>
