  <h1>Applying CSS to HTML</h1>
  <p> There are three methods of applying CSS to a document: with an external stylesheet, with an internal stylesheet,
    and with inline styles. </p>
  <h2 style="color: white; background-color: red">External stylesheet</h2>
  <p> An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. </p>
  <p> This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to
    multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. </p>
  <h2 style="color: white; background-color: red">Internal stylesheet</h2>
  <p> An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a
    &lt;style&gt; element contained inside the HTML &lt;head&gt;. </p>
  <p> In some circumstances, internal stylesheets can be useful. For example, when you quickly want to test a CSS rule
    or perhaps you're working with a content management system where you are blocked from modifying external CSS
    files.<br>
  </p>
  <h2 style="color: white; background-color: red">Inline styles</h2>
  <p> Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style attribute </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Avoid using CSS in this way, when possible.</strong> It is the opposite of a best practice.
  </p>
  <p> You might have to resort to using inline styles if your working environment is very restrictive. For example,
    perhaps your CMS only allows you to edit the HTML body. </p>
