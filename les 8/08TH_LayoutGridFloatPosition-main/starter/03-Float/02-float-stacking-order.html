    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
    <div class="clearfix">
      <p>
        In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him
        get around the royal gardens faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        The device know as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse") was made of wood,
        and propelled by pushing your feed on the ground in a gliding movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not seen a suitable for any place other than a well maintained
        pathway.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1865, the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") attached pedals to the
        front wheel, but its wooden structure made it extremely uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. The pedals were attached
        directly to the front wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel provided
        a much smoother ride than its predecessor.
